  Node-Docker-App

The  Node-Docker-App  is a modern web application built using  Node.js  and  Docker . The project demonstrates best practices in containerization and RESTful API development, aimed at streamlining development and deployment in both local and cloud environments.

   Key Features:
-  Node.js Backend : Developed with a strong API layer to handle backend services.
-  Dockerized Environment : The entire application is containerized to ensure seamless deployment, portability, and scaling.
-  RESTful API : Implements RESTful design principles for efficient and clean client-server communication.
-  Environment Configuration : Flexible configuration through environment variables, allowing for easy adaptation to various deployment scenarios.

  Tools and Technologies:
- Node.js : Core backend framework for building scalable web services.
- Docker : For containerizing the application, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
- Git : Version control for managing project changes.
- Postman : Used for testing the exposed RESTful APIs.
- Kubernetes (Planned) : Future transition to Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- CI/CD Pipeline (Planned) : Implementing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

This project serves as a foundation for future enhancements, such as Kubernetes deployment and the setup of a CI/CD pipeline, making it a comprehensive solution for modern web app development.
