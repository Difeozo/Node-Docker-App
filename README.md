Node-Docker-App

 Overview

The Node-Docker-App is a modern web application built using Node.js and Docker, designed to demonstrate best practices in containerization, microservices architecture, and CI/CD workflows. This project aims to streamline the development and deployment processes, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and ease of management in cloud environments.

 Features

- Node.js Backend : A robust backend service developed with Node.js, providing APIs for frontend interaction.
- Dockerized Environment : Fully containerized application for seamless deployment and scaling.
- RESTful API : Implements RESTful principles for effective communication between the client and server.
- Environment Configuration : Easy customization of environment variables for different deployment scenarios.

 Getting Started

To get started with the Node-Docker-App, follow the steps below to set up the development environment.

Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Docker (v20 or later)
- Git 

 Installation

1. Clone the Repository :
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Difeozo/Node-Docker-App.git
 cd Node-Docker-App
Build the Docker Image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t node-docker-app .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-docker-app
Access the Application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Usage
This application exposes a set of APIs that can be tested using Postman or any other API client. Below are some key endpoints:

GET /api/endpoint: Description of the endpoint.
POST /api/endpoint: Description of the endpoint.
PUT /api/endpoint: Description of the endpoint.
DELETE /api/endpoint: Description of the endpoint.
Postman Collection
To facilitate API testing, a Postman collection can be created and shared, which includes all available endpoints, sample requests, and responses. This will enhance the development workflow and provide a clear understanding of the API functionalities.

Next Steps
As part of the future development roadmap, we plan to integrate the following:

Postman Integration: Utilize Postman for automated API testing and documentation. This will include creating and managing collections for all endpoints, enabling easier testing and collaboration among team members.

Kubernetes Deployment: Transition the application to a Kubernetes environment to manage container orchestration. This will enhance scalability, availability, and reliability, allowing for efficient resource management and deployment strategies.

CI/CD Pipeline Implementation: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment processes, ensuring that new changes are continuously integrated and deployed without manual intervention.
